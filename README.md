## take_a_break_remake: A beach sunset simulation

I have long enjoyed "Homestar Runner" (http://www.homestarrunner.com), a website of comedic cartoons made in Macromedia Flash.

One time, a character watches a simulated beach sunset, complete with waves and seagulls, on his early 1980s computer.  [(screenshot of the original)](homestarrunner_original.png)  I enjoyed the idea and would have liked to see a modern, less pixellated version.  Since learning to program, I decided to try it myself.  All credit for the idea goes to Homestar Runner and its creators.

####Current features (2-19-17):
- Show gradient sky, water, and sand colors, as well as a setting sun.
- At this point, it doesn't do much and doesn't even have a reflection of the sun, but it looks nice and is my first try programming any sort of graphics.  I threw it together in a couple hours.
