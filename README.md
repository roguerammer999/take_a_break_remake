## take_a_break_remake: A beach sunset simulation

I have long enjoyed "Homestar Runner" (http://www.homestarrunner.com), which is a website of funny, wholesome cartoons and skits made in Macromedia Flash.


One time, a character decides to relieve his stress by watching a simulated beach sunset on his computer, complete with waves and seagulls, but all of his technology is outdated, so it is pixellated as if it were created in the early 1980s.  I enjoyed the idea and would have liked to see a modern, more realistic version.  Since learning to program, I decided to try it myself.  All credit for the idea goes to Homestar Runner and its creators.  File ["homestarrunner_original.png"](homestarrunner_original.png) is a screenshot of the original.

####Current features (2-19-17):
- Show gradient sky, water, and sand colors, as well as a setting sun.
- At this point, it doesn't do much and doesn't even have a reflection of the sun, but it looks nice and is my first try programming any sort of graphics.  I threw it together in a couple hours.
